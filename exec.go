/*
RevokeExternalGrantsFolders is the entry point for IAM revoker Cloud Function.

This sample Cloud Function will be triggered when Event Threat Detection
detects an anomalous IAM grant. Once triggered this function will
attempt to revoke the external members added to the policy if they contain
domains considered disallowed. These members must also be in the folder
specified within main.tf. This configuration allows you to take a
remediation action only certain specific members and folders. For example,
maybe you have a folder "development" where users can experiment and a folder
"production". You may want to restrict and revoke external grants to the
"production" folder and not restrict activity within "development".

In order for this revoke to be possible the generated service account must have the
appropriate permissions required. This can be accomplished in a few ways,
grant the service account permission at the orgainization, folder or
project level. For more information see README.md.
